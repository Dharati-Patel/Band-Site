# Bandsite Website

## Project Overview

BandSite is a fully functional and responsive website created for an up-and-coming band. The project was developed over three sprints, each with specific deliverables and improvements. The website was built using HTML, Sass, JavaScript, and integrated with an API for dynamic content. The website provides information about the band, allows users to comment on the bandâ€™s bio page, and view upcoming shows.
